TheatreCMS Project

Project Scope:
Work with a small revolving team to develop a website for a local theatre company.  Using C#, JavaScript, JSon, JQuery, HTML, and CSS.  

Within this project, my part included refactoring functionality from a helper class to a model that allowed for continued JSon file interaction.  This code can be found within the AdminSettings.cs file.  I also animated a bug reporting tab that maintained its state throughout the website allowing for developers to easily add potential issues to a backend file.  This required edits to the existing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery.
